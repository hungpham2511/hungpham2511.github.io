Hello there!

I am a second year phD candidate at Nanyang Technological University,
Singapore studying under [Dr. Quang-Cuong Pham][1].

My primary research interests are techniques for motion planning and
control for robots. I investigate algorithms that can plan dynamically
feasible motions for robots (it is really challenging, think of, say,
a humanoid) and also control strategies that allow stable executions.
Do check out the **[Research page][3]** and the
**[Software page][4]** for more details.

Currently I am looking at possible applications
of [Reinforcement Learning][2] to robotics. Despite the recent surge
in popularity of Reinforcement Learning, there has yet been any
convincing proof showing that these techniques are competitive for
robotic tasks with stringent safety requirements.
