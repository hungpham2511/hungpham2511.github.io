Hello there!

I am a second year phD candidate at Nanyang Technological University,
Singapore studying under [Dr. Quang-Cuong Pham][1].

My research interests lie in motion planning and control for
robots. Mostly robotic manipulators, but sometime I do get to play
with the fancy humanoids. I investigate algorithms that can plan
dynamically feasible motions for robots and also control strategies
that allow stable executions.  Do check out the **[Research page][3]**
and the **[Software page][4]** for more details.

Currently I am looking at possible applications of [Reinforcement
Learning][2] and more generally Machine Learning to robotics.
