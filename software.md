`toppra` 
========

([Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07239), [Code][1]) This Github repository contains an
implementation of the Time-Optimal Path Parametrization via
Reachability Analysis (**TOPPRA**) algorithm. Given a geometric path
(for robots) and prescribed constraints, `toppra` computes the
*time-optimal* parametrization of that path.
