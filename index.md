Hello there!

My name is *Hung Pham*. I am currently pursuing a phD degree at Nanyang
Technological University in Singapore. My supervisor is
[Dr. Quang-Cuong Pham][1].

My research interests lie in motion planning and control for robotic
manipulators. I investigate algorithms that can plan dynamically
feasible motions for robots and also control strategies that allow
stable executions. 

I spent a great deal of time recently working on
[toppra](https://github.com/hungpham2511/toppra) -- a library for path
parameterizations.  [toppra](https://github.com/hungpham2511/toppra)
implements a very fast and robust parametrization algorithm which 
results from my research.


Please check out the **[Research page][3]** and the **[Software
page][4]** for more details. If you have any queries, just send me an
email. I will be glad to answer.

Thank you!

Hung
