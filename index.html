  Hello there!
  </p>

<p>
  I am a second year phD candidate at Nanyang Technological
  University, Singapore studying under Dr. Quang-Cuong Pham
  (<a href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/cuong/">CRI group</a>).  My
  research interests align with motion planning and control for
  robotics. Our works can be found in
  the <a href="{{site.url}}/research"> research </a> page.
  
</p>

<p>
  Currently I am looking at possible applications of Reinforcement
  Learning to robotics. Despite the recent surge in popularity of
  Reinforcement Learning, there has yet been any convincing proof
  showing that these techniques are competitive for robotic tasks with
  stringent safety requirements.
