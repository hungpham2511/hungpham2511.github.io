Changing presentation layout, class or selecting *beamer presentation*:
```latex
  \documentclass[pdf, mathserif, aspectratio=169]{beamer}
```

To show slide number, add this line near the beginning:
```latex
\setbeamertemplate{footline}[frame number] 
```

To alert readers of an important content

```latex
  This text will be shown \alert{red}
```

A block of text:
```latex
  \begin{block}{Problem Statement}
    Retime a geometric path subject to the following constraints:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item joint velocity bounds;
    \item joint acceleration bounds;
    \item joint torque bounds;
    \item Friction between robot and enviroment;
    \item Suction/grasp force between robot and object.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}
```

Different block variants
```latex
  \begin{alertblock}{Research problem}
    Computing time-parametrization remains challenging in practice.
  \end{alertblock}

  \begin{example}{Example problems}
    stuffs.
  \end{example}
```

Font size:
```latex
    \Huge
    \huge
    \LARGE
    \Large
    \large
    \normalsize (default)
    \small
    \footnotesize
    \scriptsize
    \tiny
```


Dynamically show or hide components in beamer. For example: switch
from displaying one figure to another in two consecutive frames.

```latex
\begin{overlayarea}{\textwidth}{6cm}
    \only<1>{
	% code to display figure 1
	}
	\only<2>{
	% code to display figure 2
	}
\end{overlayarea}
```

Note that the overlay area, which is where the figures are drawn, has
fixed size and are set during initialization.

To reveal a list item by item, use `\pause`
```latex
  \begin{block}{Problem Statement}
    Retime a geometric path subject to the following constraints:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item joint velocity bounds; \pause
    \item joint acceleration bounds; \pause
    \item joint torque bounds; \pause
    \item Friction between robot and enviroment; \pause
    \item Suction/grasp force between robot and object.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}
```
