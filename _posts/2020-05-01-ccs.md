## Abstract

  Controlling contacts is truly challenging, and this has been a major
  hurdle to deploying industrial robots into
  unstructured/human-centric environments. More specifically, the main
  challenges are: (i) how to ensure stability at all times; (ii) how
  to satisfy task-specific performance specifications; (iii) how to
  achieve (i) and (ii) under environment uncertainty, robot parameters
  uncertainty, sensor and actuator time delays, external
  perturbations, etc. Here, we propose a new approach -- Convex
  Controller Synthesis (CCS) -- to tackle the above challenges based
  on robust control theory and convex optimization. In two physical
  interaction tasks -- robot hand guiding and sliding on surfaces with
  different and unknown stiffnesses -- we show that CCS controllers
  outperform their classical counterparts in an essential way.

Two experiments we perform in preparation for the manuscript:
Hand-guiding and force control using the same.
