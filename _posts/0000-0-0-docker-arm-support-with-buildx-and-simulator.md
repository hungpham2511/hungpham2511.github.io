Recently in my work at Eureka Robotics, we need to build Docker images
for devices running on `arm` architecture. Fortunately, this is
possible using the new build engine `BuildKit` that the folks at
Docker has been developing in the last few years. (I believe [this
GitHub issue](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/34227) is the starting point of this effort).

While it is possible to work with the `BuildKit` daemon directly, it
is not the most convenient approach. In fact, Docker's own
documentation suggests two main alternatives:

-   the [`buildx`](https://github.com/docker/buildx) CLI plugin;
-   set `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1` and use `docker build` ([reference](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build%5Fenhancements/)).

At the time of this writing, both approaches use `BuildKit`
internally. However, the details are different.

`buildx` creates `buildkit` daemons in docker containers and
communicates with them. `buildx` manages the life-cycle of buildkit
daemons: creating, configuring, starting, stopping and
removal. Because the daemons are created by `buildx` itself, building
mutli-arch images is possible.

`docker build` with `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1` in contrast uses the
`buildkit` binary shipped with the `docker` binary. The life cycle is
managed by `docker` itself and thus has a more limited level of
customisation. Perharps this is why building mutli-arch images is not
possible with this approach.


## Building images with buildx {#building-images-with-buildx}


### Buildx overview {#buildx-overview}

`buildx` introduces the concept of _builders_. A builder is
fundamentally is an isolated build environment that is responsible
for building images.

A builder uses _a driver_ to manage different build
configurations. Currently there are two drivers: `docker` and
`docker-container`. `docker` driver is the default one used by the
"traditional" docker daemon. `docker-container` driver spins a
docker container running a `BuildKit` docker image.

To inspect a builder, use the `buildx inspect` command:

```shell
docker buildx inspect default
# Name:   default
# Driver: docker
#
# Nodes:
# Name:      default
# Endpoint:  default
# Status:    running
# Platforms: linux/amd64, linux/386

```

Notice that the default builder can only work on `linux/amd64` and
`linux/386`. It can't build image for `arm` architecture. Also
notice that the default builder use the docker driver.

This is the inspect result for another builder on my computer which
can build for `arm`.

```shell
docker buildx inspect builder-test
# Name:   builder-test
# Driver: docker-container

# Nodes:
# Name:      builder-test0
# Endpoint:  unix:///var/run/docker.sock
# Status:    running
# Platforms: linux/amd64, linux/arm64, linux/386

```


### Building images with buildx {#building-images-with-buildx}

Using buildx to build image ([main reference](https://www.docker.com/blog/getting-started-with-docker-for-arm-on-linux/)):

-   In this folder <~/projects/docker-multiarch/>, there are a
    Dockerfile and a buildkitd.toml configuration file.

    Create and use new builder using these command

    ```shell
    docker buildx create --name builder-test --config buildkitd.toml
    docker buildx use builder-test
    docker buildx inspect --bootstrap

    # âžœ  docker-multiarch docker buildx inspect --bootstrap
    # [+] Building 5.1s (1/1) FINISHED
    #  => [internal] booting buildkit                                                                     5.1s
    #  => => pulling image moby/buildkit:buildx-stable-1                                                  4.1s
    #  => => creating container buildx_buildkit_builder-test0                                             0.9s
    # Name:   builder-test
    # Driver: docker-container
    #
    # Nodes:
    # Name:      builder-test0
    # Endpoint:  unix:///var/run/docker.sock
    # Status:    running
    # Platforms: linux/amd64, linux/arm64, linux/386
    ```

    This builder can be used to build containers for 3 platforms:
    `linux/amd64, linux/arm64, linux/386`.


### Create new `builder` using configuration file. {#create-new-builder-using-configuration-file-dot}

`buildx` builders that use the `docker-container` driver create a
docker container running `buildkit` daemon. One can pass a buildkit
configuration file at this stage to configure the buildkit daemon.
Example configurations include cache storage size and policy cache.

To create a new builder based on a configuration file. This was use
for example [here](https://github.com/docker/buildx/issues/136) to configure application.

```sh
docker buildx create --config=buildkitd.toml
```

[This](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/blob/master/docs/buildkitd.toml.md) is the official guide for `buildkitd.toml`. To understand this
configuration file, this [note on architecture](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/32925) of BuildKit is
useful.

To enable Garbage Collection (GC), ensure that the following is
presented in the buildkit configuration file:

```toml
[worker.oci]
  gc = true
  gckeepstorage = 20000
```

This configuration enables GC and set the keep storage to 20000Mb,
which is around 20Gb. This can also be achieved without an
configuration file by setting the `--buildkitd-flags`:

```sh
docker buildx create --buildkitd-flags '--oci-worker-gc --oci-worker-gc-keepstorage 20000'
```

The defauflt GC policy follows a few pruning steps. Details can be
found [here](https://github.com/docker/cli/pull/2864/files).

Unfortunately, I think the only way to gain a better understanding
of how buildx work is to understand how BuildKit and buildx are
developed. This means to know how to use [the go programming
language]({{< relref "go-programming-language" >}}).


## Build docker images for arm using amd {#build-docker-images-for-arm-using-amd}

Below are the steps I have taken to build docker images for `arm`
architecture on a `amd` machine.

-   Install docker 19.03 for `buildx` support.
-   Install Docker support for QEMU by running

    ```sh
    docker run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt --install all
    ```

    as suggested in <https://github.com/docker/buildx/>
-   Install `qemu` using `apt-get`

    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install qemu qemu-user-static
    ```
-   We can then test by running

    ```sh
    docker run --rm -t arm64v8/ubuntu uname -m  # Testing the emulation environment
    ```
-   At this stage technically we are able to build images for `arm`
    based systems.
-   Important: If QEMU simulation stops working run `docker run --rm
        --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes`. This
    should re-register different hooks for `QEMU` and `binfmt` and the
    simulation should work again ([reference](https://github.com/multiarch/qemu-user-static)).
