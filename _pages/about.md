Hello there!

My name is *Hung Pham*. I am currently pursuing a phD degree at
Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, under the supervision
of [Dr. Quang-Cuong Pham][1].

My research interests lie in motion planning and control for robotic
manipulators. I investigate algorithms that can plan dynamically
feasible motions for robots and also control strategies that allow
stable executions. 

I spent a great deal of time recently working on
[toppra](https://github.com/hungpham2511/toppra) -- a library for path
parameterizations.  [toppra](https://github.com/hungpham2511/toppra)
implements a very fast and robust parametrization algorithm which I
developed [here (arXiv paper)][5]


And if you are interested: 
- [a list of publications](/research), 
- [my CV](https://github.com/hungpham2511/hungpham2511.github.io/raw/master/assets/cv_hungpham.pdf).


Thank you and have a nice day!

Hung
